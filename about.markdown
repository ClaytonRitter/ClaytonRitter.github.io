# About Me

Hmmmm what do I say here. My name is XXXX XXXXXX and I'm currently developing an indie game called Anther. Right now the entire project is being driven by me in my spare time, though it is far from a solo project with all the inspiring conversations I have had with people who are interested in it.

I am just a person. My work is unique to me, and it draws on all (and I mean ALL, whether I wish it or no) of my life experiences. It is an extension of my personality. It is very imperfect.

My creative process is wholistic, and I make shit that I CARE about.
