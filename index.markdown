# Hello Fellow Inhabitants of Late Capitalist Hell!

I Am claytron, Your Friend and Equal in This Universe. I just made this website because I wanted to, and even though it contains blog posts, that doesn't mean I enjoy writing. In fact I don't really enjoy writing (or often talking) but it is a necessary skill to turn thoughts into communicable letters and syllables, and I have some thoughts that I want to share with the world this way.

I also have other thoughts I would like to share in the form of images, and also experiences.
Some of that stuff is in the attic, go have a look.\
It's just right up [THESE STAIRS]({% link stairs.markdown %}).

Some of that stuff is also in the basement though. You can look down there too. If the basement makes you uncomfortable, you can always leave.\
